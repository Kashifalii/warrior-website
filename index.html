                            Macedon.
                            He was born in 980 AD and died in 1000 AD. He was the first king of Sparta.He was born in
                            356 BCE at Pella in Macedonia, the son of Philip II and Olympias (daughter of King
                            Neoptolemus of Epirus). From age 13 to 16 he was taught by Aristotle, who inspired him with
                            an interest in philosophy, medicine, and scientific investigation, but he was later to
                            advance beyond his teacher’s narrow precept that non-Greeks should be treated as slaves.
                            Left in charge of Macedonia in 340 during Philip’s attack on Byzantium, Alexander defeated
                            the Maedi, a Thracian people. Two years later he commanded the left wing at the Battle of
                            Chaeronea, in which Philip defeated the allied Greek states, and displayed personal courage
                            in breaking the Sacred Band of Thebes, an elite military corps composed of 150 pairs of
                            lovers. A year later Philip divorced Olympias, and, after a quarrel at a feast held to
                            celebrate his father’s new marriage, Alexander and his mother fled to Epirus, and Alexander
                            later went to Illyria. Shortly afterward, father and son were reconciled and Alexander
                            returned, but his position as heir was jeopardized. </p>

                        <p id="para">Tiberius’s father, also named Tiberius Claudius Nero, a high priest and magistrate,
                            was a former fleet captain for
                            Julius Caesar. His mother, the beautiful Livia Drusilla, was her husband’s cousin and may
                            have been only 13 years old
                            when Tiberius was born. In the civil wars following the assassination of Julius Caesar, the
                            elder Tiberius gave his
                            allegiance to Mark Antony, Caesar’s protégé. When Augustus, Caesar’s grandnephew and heir,
                            fell out with Antony and
                            defeated him in the ensuing power struggle, the elder Tiberius and his family became
                            fugitives.<br><br> They fled first to
                            Sicily and then to Greece, but by the time Tiberius was three years old an amnesty was
                            granted and the family was able
                            to return to Rome.In 39 BCE Augustus had the power, if not yet the title, of emperor.
                            Attracted by the beauty of Livia, who was at that
                            time pregnant with a second son, Augustus divorced his own wife, who was also pregnant, and,
                            forcing the elder Tiberius
                            to give up Livia, married her</p>

                        <p id="para">King Claudius is a fictional character and the main antagonist of William
                            Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet. He is the
                            brother to King Hamlet, second husband to Gertrude and uncle and later stepfather to Prince
                            Hamlet. He obtained the
                            throne of Denmark by murdering his brother with poison and then marrying the late king's
                            widow. He is loosely based on
                            the Jutish chieftain Feng who appears in Chronicon Lethrense and in Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta
                            Danorum. There has never
                            been an actual Danish king of that name.Claudius is seen at the beginning of the play to be
                            a capable monarch as he deals diplomatically with such issues as the
                            military threat from Norway and Hamlet's depression. It is not until the appearance of King
                            Hamlet's Ghost in the
                            courtyard that the audience questions his motives. During the play's progression he takes a
                            turn for the worse by first
                            resorting to spying, and, when that fails, murder. </p>

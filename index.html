                                He was born in 980 AD and died in 1000 AD. He was the first king of Sparta.He was born
                                in
                                356 BCE at Pella in Macedonia, the son of Philip II and Olympias (daughter of King
                                Neoptolemus of Epirus). From age 13 to 16 he was taught by Aristotle, who inspired him
                                with
                                an interest in philosophy, medicine, and scientific investigation, but he was later to
                                advance beyond his teacher’s narrow precept that non-Greeks should be treated as slaves.
                                Left in charge of Macedonia in 340 during Philip’s attack on Byzantium, Alexander
                                defeated
                                the Maedi, a Thracian people. Two years later he commanded the left wing at the Battle

                                Chaeronea, in which Philip defeated the allied Greek states, and displayed personal
                                courage
                                in breaking the Sacred Band of Thebes, an elite military corps composed of 150 pairs of
                                lovers. A year later Philip divorced Olympias, and, after a quarrel at a feast held to
                                celebrate his father’s new marriage, Alexander and his mother fled to Epirus, and
                                Alexander
                                later went to Illyria. Shortly afterward, father and son were reconciled and Alexander

                                Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet. He is the
                                brother to King Hamlet, second husband to Gertrude and uncle and later stepfather to
                                Prince
                                Hamlet. He obtained the
                                throne of Denmark by murdering his brother with poison and then marrying the late king's
                                widow. He is loosely based on
                                the Jutish chieftain Feng who appears in Chronicon Lethrense and in Saxo Grammaticus'
                                Gesta
                                Danorum. There has never
                                been an actual Danish king of that name.Claudius is seen at the beginning of the play to
                                be
                                a capable monarch as he deals diplomatically with such issues as the
                                military threat from Norway and Hamlet's depression. It is not until the appearance of
                                King
                                Hamlet's Ghost in the
                                courtyard that the audience questions his motives. During the play's progression he
                                takes a
                                turn for the worse by first
                                resorting to spying, and, when that fails, murder. </p>
